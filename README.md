vsaa-exitgames-webhook
==================

Very Simple Application Analytics server made using Node.js, Restify, VoltDB.

Intented to run in conjuction with exitgames photon application plugin.

Based on examples from
[restify-oauth2](https://github.com/domenic/restify-oauth2) and
[node-mysql-json-server](https://github.com/frodefi/node-mysql-json-server).

This project depends on several npm packages. Make sure you have npm packages restify, underscore, crypto, sharedmemory and mysql/mongodb installed before trying to run it. Easiest way to take care of this on Linux and OS X is to run install.sh, which does the module installations for you.
